            <p>Your privacy is a top priority for us at AthletaSync ("we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy is designed to be as clear and straightforward as possible. It explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage, update, and delete your information.</p>
            <p class="bg-sky-900/50 text-sky-200 p-4 rounded-lg border border-sky-700"><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> We are committed to never selling your personal data. Our business model is based on providing a valuable service, not on monetizing your information.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We only collect information that is essential to provide and improve the AthletaSync service. This falls into two categories:</p>

            <h3>a) Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an AthletaSync account, we ask for your email address and name.</li>
                <li><strong>Athlete Profile Information:</strong> To personalize your training recommendations, we ask you to voluntarily provide your age, gender, primary sport focus, details about your goal event (type and date), and a general history of recent or chronic injuries. You are not required to provide this information, but its absence may limit the accuracy of our recommendations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>b) Information We Collect via the Garmin Connect API:</h3>
            <p>With your explicit and revocable consent, we access data from your Garmin Connect account. We only request permission to read data and cannot write, edit, or delete anything in your Garmin account. This data includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Activity Data:</strong> Details from your recorded activities, such as running, cycling, etc. This includes metrics like distance, duration, speed, elevation, heart rate, power, and cadence.</li>
                <li><strong>Physiological Data:</strong> Daily health and wellness metrics, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV) status, resting heart rate, and sleep data (duration and stages).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect GPS location data from your activities. While we process the activity as a whole, we have no interest in where you train.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information for one purpose: to provide you with personalized training load analysis and recommendations. Specifically, we use it to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authenticate your account and connect securely to the Garmin Connect API.</li>
                <li>Calculate your training load, Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR), and other performance metrics.</li>
                <li>Integrate your HRV and sleep data to assess your recovery and readiness to train.</li>
                <li>Generate and display your personalized weekly training load recommendations based on your profile, goals, and physiological data.</li>
                <li>Communicate with you about essential service updates or to respond to your support requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may use <strong>anonymized and aggregated</strong> data for internal research to improve our algorithms and the overall service. This data cannot be linked back to any individual.</p>

            <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your privacy and trust are paramount. Our policy on sharing data is simple: <strong>we don't.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your personal and physiological data with any third-party marketers, data brokers, or advertisers.</li>
                <li>We may use trusted third-party service providers for essential operations like secure cloud hosting (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud). These providers are bound by strict confidentiality and security agreements and do not have permission to use or access your data for any other purpose.</li>
                <li>We will only disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take the security of your data seriously. We use industry-standard technical and administrative security measures—including data encryption at rest and in transit—to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access.</p>

            <h2>5. Your Rights and Control</h2>
            <p>You are in control of your data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can review and update your profile information at any time within your account settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnect from Garmin:</strong> You can revoke AthletaSync's access to your Garmin Connect data at any time through your Garmin Connect account settings. This will stop any future data synchronization.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can permanently delete your AthletaSync account at any time. When you delete your account, <strong>all of your personal data and synchronized training history will be permanently and irreversibly deleted</strong> from our production systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>AthletaSync is not intended for or directed at individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the email address associated with your account or by placing a prominent notice on our website.</p>

            <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
